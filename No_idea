#There is an array of n integers. There are also 2 disjoint sets, A and B, each containing m integers.
#You like all the integers in set A and dislike all the integers in set B.
#Your initial happiness is 0. For each i integer in the array, if i belongs to A, you add 1 to your happiness.
#If i belongs to B, you add -1 to your happiness.
#Otherwise, your happiness does not change. Output your final happiness at the end.
#Note: Since A and B are sets, they have no repeated elements. However, the array might contain duplicate elements.
